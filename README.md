# Basic Calculator

A basic calculator recreated in code.

## :thinking: Why I built this

I like to recreate image and items in CSS but I've been mostly sticking to animations and cartoony looking objects. I decided to take an image of a calculator and try to recreate that image. After recreating the image I wanted to make the calculator more than just a picture and so I added JavaScript to make it function like a real calculator!
